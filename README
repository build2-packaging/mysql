MySQL is a relational SQL database management system with libmysqlclient being
its C client library. Applications can use this library to pass queries to
MySQL database servers and to receive the results of those queries using the C
programming language. For more information see:

https://www.mysql.com

This package contains the original libmysqlclient library source code overlaid
with the build2-based build system and packaged for the build2 package manager
(bpkg).

See the INSTALL file for the prerequisites and installation instructions.

Send questions, bug reports, or any other feedback about the library itself to
the MySQL mailing lists. Send build system and packaging-related feedback to
the packaging@build2.org mailing list (see https://lists.build2.org for posting
guidelines, etc).

The packaging of libmysqlclient for build2 is tracked in a Git repository at:

https://git.build2.org/cgit/packaging/mysql/
