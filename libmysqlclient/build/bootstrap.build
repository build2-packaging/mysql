# The MySQL client library ABI version number has the <major>.<minor>.<patch>
# form. The major number is increased for backwards-incompatible API changes,
# the minor number for backwards-compatible ones (for example, for adding a new
# function), and the patch number is typically increased for each package
# release, being in a sense redundant. Increase of the version component resets
# the rightmost ones to zero. See also:
#
# http://mysqlserverteam.com/the-client-library-part-2-the-version-number/
#
# There is no way to deduce the ABI version from the release version, so we
# obtain the ABI version from the SHARED_LIB_MAJOR_VERSION variable value in
# upstream/cmake/mysql_version.cmake for each package release. Also, while at
# it, check that the protocol version is still correct (the PROTOCOL_VERSION
# variable).
#
# See also how Debian/Fedora package libmysqlclient if trying to wrap your head
# around this mess.
