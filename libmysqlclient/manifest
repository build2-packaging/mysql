# System package mapping.

# Note that versioning of the default-libmysqlclient-dev meta-package differs
# from that of the underlying implementation package, which may actually be
# the MariaDB client library. Thus, we map the distribution package version to
# the minimum possible bpkg version of the package.
#
# Also note that the unstable distribution contains the MySQL-based
# libmysqlclient-dev package, which we may potentially use for the future
# Debian versions.
