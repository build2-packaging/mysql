MySQL is a relational SQL database management system with mysql utility being
its command-line client. It supports interactive and noninteractive use. When
used interactively, query results are presented in an ASCII-table format. When
used noninteractively, the result is presented in tab-separated format. For
more information see:

This package contains the original mysql utility source code overlaid with the
build2-based build system and packaged for the build2 package manager (bpkg).

See the INSTALL file for the prerequisites and installation instructions.

Send questions, bug reports, or any other feedback about the utility itself to
the MySQL mailing lists. Send build system and packaging-related feedback to
the packaging@build2.org mailing list (see https://lists.build2.org for
posting guidelines, etc).

The packaging of mysql utility for build2 is tracked in a Git repository at:
